## Introduction

OTS is committed to building a safe, welcoming, harassment-free culture for everyone. We do not merely want a work environment that is free from hostility; we want one that is actively welcoming and inclusive. We want our team and our workplace culture to reflect and celebrate the diversity of the communities we serve.

The Code of Conduct summarizes federal and state anti-harassment law and the Louisiana Division of Administration policy. We intend the plain-language approach to promote a culture of inclusion and respect.

We expect everyone on the OTS team to exhibit these behaviors and abide by applicable federal and state laws as well as DOA policies. In addition, we expect everyone within OTS spaces to exhibit these behaviors and refrain from behavior prohibited by anti-harassment laws and DOA policies on harassment. These spaces include:

- OTS&#39;s physical offices,
- OTS events and meetings,
- All of our online forums and virtual collaboration tools, including:
  - Office chat rooms, like Slack and Teams
  - Mailing lists and emails
  - Code repositories, like GitHub

## What We Strive For

We strive to create a welcoming and inclusive culture that empowers people to provide outstanding public service. That kind of atmosphere requires an open exchange of ideas balanced by thoughtful guidelines. If we have only openness, colleagues who are on the receiving end of thoughtless or intentionally hurtful comments and behavior may reasonably withdraw. If we have overly intrusive guidelines, people may feel unwelcome.

It would be impossible to list everything staff can do to create a more welcoming space, and we know this team will find ways to include their colleagues that we haven&#39;t even thought of. But when in doubt, we encourage you to look to these principles for guidance:

- Practice empathy and humility.
- Assume competence in your colleagues, clients and the public.
- Assume that everyone we work with is doing their best work for the public.
- Listen carefully and actively.
- Ask questions, and seek to understand your partners&#39; context.
- Encourage other people to listen as much as they speak.
- Treat other people&#39;s identities and cultures with respect. Make an effort to say people&#39;s names correctly and refer to them by their chosen pronouns.

## Unacceptable Behavior

To help colleagues understand the kinds of behaviors that are illegal or run counter to the culture we seek to foster, we&#39;ve listed below actions that violate federal law and DOA policy. We&#39;ve also included steps to take if you encounter behavior that runs contrary to this policy.

### Discrimination and Harassment

The [DOA Personnel Policy on Discrimination and Harassment](https://www.doa.la.gov/media/khffqty1/personnel-policy-no-107.pdf) prohibits harassment or discrimination based on:

- race
- color

- national origin

Additionally, [DOA Personnel Policy Prohibiting Sexual Harassment](https://www.doa.la.gov/media/yi5nfeln/personnel-policy-no-106.pdf) includes additional information regarding prohibitions against sexually inappropriate behavior.


## Reporting Violations

The process for reporting violations of [DOA&#39;s Policy Prohibiting Discrimination and Harassment](https://www.doa.la.gov/media/khffqty1/personnel-policy-no-107.pdf) can be found in section IX of the policy.

## Credits

We drew heavily from the the [TTS Code of Conduct](https://github.com/18F/code-of-conduct/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md) in building this document. Please also refer to the following policies from the Louisiana Division of Administration:
