## Best Practices

Use this when you’re ready to direct the reader to take an action, like signing up.
  - The big text is the action verb for the goal you have for the user.
  - This is a decision moment, don’t put a lot of text in here.
  - A Call-to-Action is not navigation, it is a persuasion with a link to what you want the user to do.

## Usage

{% include markup/highlight-cta.njk %}

``` html
{% include markup/highlight-cta.njk %}
```
