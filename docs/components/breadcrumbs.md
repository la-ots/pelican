## Best Practices

- Breadcrumbs give the user a way to travel up the information hierarchy of the digital product
- Breadcrumbs are not primary navigation
- They are best used for products requiring multiple levels of navigation
- They are not used to show a user the path they took to navigate to the current page
- They show the user their current place within the site or app’s hierarchy
- The Home icon always goes to the Homepage.
- On smaller devices, breadcrumbs only display the current page and a link to its parent in the information hierarchy.
- Place Breadcrumbs immediately above the Page Title UI Block.
