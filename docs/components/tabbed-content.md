## Best Practices
- Tabbed content allows users to choose which content they want to see.
- Use tabbed content to small bits of content at a time.
- Rounded style tabs work better on small devices.
- Tabs are for selective content display, not navigation.
- You may need to put tabbed content into [Layout Grid](/foundation/layout-grid/) items.

## Usage
### Rounded Style

{% include 'markup/tabbed-content-rounded.njk' %}

``` html
{% include 'markup/tabbed-content-rounded.njk' %}
```

### Traditional Style

{% include 'markup/tabbed-content-traditional.njk' %}

``` html
{% include 'markup/tabbed-content-traditional.njk' %}
```
