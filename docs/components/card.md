## Best Practices
Cards are designed to be flexible enough to accommodate most content types
- If a Card occurs outside of a [Content Container](/components/content_container/), it will automatically get a white background 
- If the card occurs inside of a [Content Container](/components/content_container/) it will automatically get a gray background
- Cards can contain various types of information, so their appearance will vary
- A cardâ€™s width is determined by its parent element. In most cases, this is a Bootstrap `<div>` with a column class. Read [Layout Grid](/components/layout-grid/) for more information about columns
- Rows and columns can be placed inside a card body
- Cards can be themed using theming classes. Read more in [Agency Themes](/foundation/agency-theming/)
