## Best Practices

- Badges take their size from the parent element.
- Prefer smaller badges over larger ones to prevent them from being confused with buttons.
- Keep the text in them short and succint, one or two short words.
- Use them to display a piece of data’s related quality, such as a number of notifications.
- Remove the `<span>` with the icon if you don’t need it.
- Prefer fewer badges on a page element so they don’t create visual noise.
- A dim variant of the badge may be used by adding the `badge-dim` class.
- Badges are no longer dim by default in the [Page Title](/components/page-title/) to allow for flexibility.
