## Best Practices

Badges are used for information such as:

- Use them to display a piece of dataâ€™s related quality, such as a number of notifications.
- Badges take their size from the parent element.
- Keep the text in them short and simple.

## Usage

<p class="h4">
  <span class="badge badge-primary">PTA</span>
  <span class="badge badge-secondary">OMV</span>
  <span class="badge badge-accent">Habitual</span>
  <span class="badge badge-ui">Text</span>
  <span class="badge badge-success">Running</span>
  <span class="badge badge-warning">Almost Full</span>
  <span class="badge badge-danger">5</span>
  <span class="badge badge-info">4 Messages</span>
