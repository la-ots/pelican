## Best Practices

Badges are used for information such as:

- Use them to display a piece of dataâ€™s related quality, such as a number of notifications.
- Badges take their size from the parent element.
- Keep the text in them short and simple.

## Usage

{% include 'markup/badges.njk' %}

``` html
{% include 'markup/badges.njk' %}
```
