## Best Practices

- Use Modals sparingly.
- Modals are meant to disrupt the user’s flow for important choices.
- On a small phone, all content and all user interface elements must be seen within a single screen height.
- Any buttons that close or cancel the Modal should get initial focus.
- Modals hold focus until the action is completed or dismissed. 
- Do not use Modals to notify a user of a successful or unsuccessful action; Use a [Toast](/components/toasts) instead.
- Do not use Forms in a Modal.
- Tabbing should only cycle between the buttons inside the Modal.
- For accessibility reasons do not close the Modal by tapping the Modal backdrop.
- For accessibility reasons pressing the key escape (ESC) should close or cancel the Modal.
