## Best Practices

- Use Dividers to separate content.
- Use Dividers sparingly and only when separating content.
- Major Dividers create strong separation between content. This could be between Form or content sections.
- Minor Dividers create weak separation between content. This could be between Form or content section with minor differences.
- If the divider is outside a white or gray box, but atop the background of the page, it goes edge-to-edge.
- If the divider is inside a white or gray box, it stays within the padding of the white or gray box.
- Top borders on [Back and Forward Buttons](/components/back-and-forward-buttons/) go edge-to-edge.
- Borders on Components such as [Large Progress Indicator](/components/progress/) typically go edge-to-edge.
- Add any `my-x` class to change top and bottom margin at the same time.
- Add any `mt-x` class to change top margin.
- Add any `mb-x` class to change bottom margin.
