## Best Practices

- Insert Button Container after the other content, but before any footers.
- See [Buttons](/components/buttons) for guidance on styling and writing buttons.
- Consider [buttons’ hierarchies](/components/buttons) when assigning button styles.
- If there is only 1 cautionary button, such as a `.btn-warning` or `btn-danger`, then add the class `ms-auto` to it.
- If there are 2 or more cautionary buttons, such as a `.btn-warning` or `btn-danger`, then add the class `ms-auto` to the first.
- Put Warning and Danger buttons to the right of the Button Bar by adding the class `ms-md-auto` added to the first of those buttons.
