## Best Practices

- The Official Banner is placed at the top of public-facing websites or web applications. 
- If only one langauge is used it’s ok to omit the language selector buttons.
- Do not customize the Official Banner other than to omit the language selector buttons.
- It doesn’t have the code for switching language, it only has the markup for the buttons.

## Usage

{% include markup/official-banner.njk %}

``` html
{% include markup/official-banner.njk %}
```
