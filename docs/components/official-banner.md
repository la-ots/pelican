## Best Practices

- The Official Banner is placed at the top of public-facing websites or web applications. 
- If your digital product will only be presented in English, you may omit the column with the language selector buttons.
- Do not customize the Official Banner other than to omit the language selector buttons.

_**Note**: This doesn’t contain the code for switching language, only the markup used to present the buttons used to switch language._

## Usage

{% include 'markup/official-banner.njk' %}

``` html
{% include 'markup/official-banner.njk' %}
```
