## Best Practice

- Do not use `table-striped` on this table.
- You may need to reduce the window’s width to see the table’s horizontal scrolling.
- Tables allows the user to compare data.
- Use accessible Table markup, like what’s provided.
- [Pagination](/components/pagination) goes below a table if you need it.
- Use Tables to display tabular data, not for layout.
- Tables size their columns by the longest amount of unbroken text in either the column header or the column.
- Sorting needs to [inform screen reader users](/accessibility/live-region).
