## Best Practice

- Links should open in a new window or tab.
- This markup doesn’t include the code for sharing.
- We currently present four sharing methods:
  1. Facebook
  1. LinkedIn
  1. Twitter
  1. Copying a Link for pasting elsewhere

## Usage

{% include 'markup/share-social.njk' %}

``` html
{% include 'markup/share-social.njk' %}
```
