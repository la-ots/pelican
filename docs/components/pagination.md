## Best Practices
- Use Pagination if data, such as on [Tables](/components/table), is long and needs to be split up.
- Make sure the Pagination clearly shows the current page’s number.
- Pagination is placed at the bottom of the content which it pages.

## Usage

{% include markup/pagination.njk %}

``` html
{% include markup/pagination.njk %}
```
