## Best Practices
- Pagination is used if data, such as on [Tables](/components/table), is split up into several groups
- Pagination also shows users how many sets of data they want to see at one time
- Make sure the Pagination clearly shows the current page number
- Pagination is placed at the bottom of the content which it controls

## Usage

{% include markup/pagination.njk %}

``` html
{% include markup/pagination.njk %}
```
