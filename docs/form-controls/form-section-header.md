## Best Practices

- Divide forms into smaller sections to make it easier for the user to fill out.
- Separate Form sections into different [Content Containers](/components/boxes/#content-container).
- Form Section Headers are used to introduce form sections.
- Use the Form Section Header to name each form section.
- Put the Form Section Header header and its related form fields into the same `.content-container`.
- Put the Form Section Header into its `row` and `.col-12`.
- Be sure to consult [Typography and Headings](/foundation/typography/#headings) to esure youâ€™re using the appropriate heading level.
