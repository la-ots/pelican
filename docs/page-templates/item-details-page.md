## Best Practices

- Put the most apparent information about the item at the top.
- Use a photo if you have one.
- Group the attributes about the item into separate cards.
- Arrange the attributes so that most often sought information is higher at the top.


## Usage

<a class="btn btn-primary" href="/page-templates/item-details-page-internal/" target="_blank">See Internal Preview</a>

``` html
{% include 'markup/item-details-internal.njk' %}
```
