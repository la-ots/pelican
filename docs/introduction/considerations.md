## Accessible, Equitable

Consider accessible, equitable design in your work. Pelican is built to evolve as we learn more about our users’ needs. 

## Layout

Don’t change the layouts of Pelican’s elements. Louisiana’s residents need common layouts across Louisiana government’s digital products. Even with brand colors across agencies, users become familiar to where things are placed. The purpose of Pelican is to enable residents to become familiar with a shared visual language.

## Code

Don’t change in ways other than what’s provided for customization. You may have to remedy any [Accessibility](/accessibility/about-accessibility/) or browser rendering problems on your own. If you need something Pelican doesn’t have, consult the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">Bootstrap documentation</a> as it’s the underlying framework for Pelican.

If your project requires custom work not found in either Pelican or Bootstrap, consult <a href="https://accessibility.digital.gov/front-end/getting-started/" target="_blank">Digital.gov’s guidelines on Frontend accessibility</a>.

Extensions to Pelican are welcome! Extensions will be implemented in a manner which accommodates their future use by all teams and compliance with accessibility guidelines.
