## Overview

The Pelican Design System will grow as we discover solutions created by each team. To share our knowledge and create a common knowledge base, we'll use the following process.

1. Contact the OTS Product Delivery Design Team.
1. Present the use case.
1. Weâ€™ll determine abstractions and customizations so it can be used by other teams too.
1. The OTS Product Delivery Design Team members will create visual assets in Figma which match code output.
1. Create branch in Pelican for the change.
1. Write code.
1. Pull Reviews and peer review process will occur.
1. Final merge into the Main branch.
