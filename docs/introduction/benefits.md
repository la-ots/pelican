## Overview

Pelican will enable our planning, design, development, and update efforts to be quicker and easily updated.

By using a shared visual language, common code patterns, and industry best practices, our teams can use familiar visual and code components to solve common problems. As more teams are onboarded, we will be able to reuse our work and even create new reusables for future challenges.

## Solution Planning

During discovery, Pelican will allow stakeholders and product owners to see possible solutions unfold. This is because business analysts and designers will envision solutions for stakeholders using Pelicanâ€™s prebuilt [Components](/components).
