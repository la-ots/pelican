## Best Practices

- Use Hero as the first, prominent element on the page.
- Put it after an instances of the [Official Banner](/components/official-banner/) or [Navbars](/components/navbar/).
- One button is best, but two are acceptable as long as button is more prominent than the other.
- Don’t use more than two buttons.

## Usage

{% include 'markup/highlights/hero-centered.njk' %}

```html
{% include 'markup/highlights/hero-centered.njk' %}
```
