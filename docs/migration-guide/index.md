## Migration Guide

There are differences between Pelican 1 and Pelican 2. Most changes are caused by moving from Bootstrap 4.6 to 5.2. Bootstrap 5’s components often have different markup than the same component in Bootstrap 4. Pelican 2’s markup will match Bootstrap 5’s markup for components based upon Bootstrap 5. Pelican 2 markup will contain Pelican 1’s classes to ease the transition.

Other changes are caused by other development choices based upon ongoing feedback. Most changes are handled by the new Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) and Syntactically Correct Style Sheet (SCSS) work so you won’t see them. But other changes require some markup adjustments. The changes which require markup changes are listed.
