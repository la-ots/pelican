## Migration Guide

Pelican 2 is based upon Bootstrap 5 (BS5). Pelican 1 is based upon Bootstrap 4.6 (BS4). Some of the changes between BS5 and BS4 are markup changes. This means that components in Pelican 2 will be a little different from Pelican 1. 

These changes could be different markup structure or different values on the `class` attributes. The CSS of Pelican 2 has been written to provide a smooth transition. Pelican 2 will look almost exactly the same as Pelican 1. Javascript has also been updated. If you notice something broken, please [give us feedback](/feedback/).
