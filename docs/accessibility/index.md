## Overview

For Pelican, accessibility means that everyone can easily read, use, and access Louisiana’s digital products. Whether the user needs a screen reader, requires assistive inputs, has low vision, has hearing needs, needs extra considerations for reading, or has sensory considerations, they will be able to get value from Louisiana’s digital products.
