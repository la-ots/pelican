## Best Practice

Users who rely on keyboard navigation need a way to skip past navigation elements if they are already familiar with the page.

- Put the Skip Link markup as a direct child of the `<body>` element.
- It should always be the first element the user can interact with on the page if they press the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key immediately after the page has loaded.

## Usage

``` html
{% include 'markup/skip-link.njk' %}
```
