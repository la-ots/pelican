## Best Practices 

- Use font sizes of 16 â€“ 19 pixels.
- Avoid underlines when possible.
- Avoid all uppercase letters when possible.
- Ensure hyperlinks are distinct from headings and normal text.
- Slightly darken the reading background. In Pelican, the class `bg-less-bright` may be added to achieve this. The card containing this content uses this class.
