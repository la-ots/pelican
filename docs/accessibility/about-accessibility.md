## Best Practices

Some best practices are included here. This list shouldn’t be assumed as complete. We’re still learning about our users, so our own body of knowledge will continue to grow. The resources below offer more comprehensive knowledge.

- Automated testing is useful, but not a replacement for human testing.
- Use semantic HTML.
- Prefer native HTML controls over custom controls. If custom controls are used, you must ensure proper ARIA usage.
- Use a [skip link](/components/skip-link/).
- Ensure [keyboard access](/accessibility/keyboard/) always works properly.
- Use [headings](/accessibility/headings/) correctly.
- Apply [alt text](/foundation/images/) to images with meaningful content.
- Give users multiple ways to navigate.
- Ensure compliant [color contrast](/accessibility/color-contrast/).
- No blinking or flashing items.
- Follow the guidance for [accessible forms](/form-controls/using-form-controls/).
- At 200% zoom or higher, the digital product should still function.
- At 200% zoom or higher, the user should only need to scroll in one direction.
- At 200% zoom or higher, all content and controls should still be accessed.
