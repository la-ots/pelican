## Overview

Accessibility isn’t a line-item that is tacked on at the end of the digital product’s development process. It has to be implemented along with UX, wireframe, design, and development choices. It's a continual part of the development process. 

When we do it properly, we even consider accessibility when creating and writing the content of the site. It will be wise to consult some <a href="http://www.ada.gov/pcatoolkit/chap5chklist.htm" target="_blank">ADA-recommended policies</a>.

## Accessibility Matters More Than You Think

According to a <a href="https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2018/demo/p70-152.pdf" target="_blank">2014 Census report on Americans with disabilities</a>, "...27.2 percent, or 85.3 million, of people living in the United States had a disability in 2014." This means that an accessibility-first mindset is the prime factor in developing accessible websites. Further, the United Nations considers the rights of persons with disabilities important enough to <a href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.html" target="_blank">discuss these rights in a convention</a>.

## Benefits

A bonus of ADA compliant accessibility is <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/accessibilityseo" target="_blank">it conforms well with SEO best practices</a>. As stated earlier, an accessible website is an easily-indexed website. This means that it’s easier for search engines to present the contents to search users. Google can index anything, but an accessible website is also in closer alignment with Google’s indexing practices.

Another benefit is that an accessible website is is open to users with any category of use-challenge. This means it will also be easier for people without any use challenges.

## Links

Read [Links in Pelican](/foundation/links/) to learn how links should be written, used, and styled for the best possible user experiences.

## Markup

Markup and front-end’s roles in Accessibility is a complex concept. For now, we will refer to and follow the advice of <a href="https://accessibility.digital.gov/front-end/getting-started/" target="_blank">Digital.gov’s Accessibility for Front-End Developers</a>. Their guidelines in this section will inform and influence our own practice.
