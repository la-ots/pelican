## Overview

Office of Technology Services, and Pelican, Louisianaâ€™s Design System, are committed to providing a website that is accessible to the widest possible audience, regardless of technology or ability. We are actively working to increase the accessibility and usability of our website and in doing so adhere to many of the available standards and guidelines. This commitment to accessibility for all begins with this site and our efforts to ensure all functionality and all content is accessible to all Louisiana Digital Products which use Pelican.

## Ongoing Committment

Pelican endeavours to conform to level Double-A of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/" target="_blank">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.</a>.<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/" target="_blank">1</a>. These guidelines explain how to make web content more accessible for people with disabilities. Conformance with these guidelines will help make the web more user friendly for all people.

This site has been built using code compliant with W3C standards for HTML and CSS. The site displays correctly in current browsers and using standards compliant HTML/CSS code means any future browsers will also display it correctly.
