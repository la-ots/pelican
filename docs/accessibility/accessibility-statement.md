## Overview

The Office of Technology Services (OTS), and Pelican, Louisiana’s Design System, are committed to providing digital products that are accessible. We are actively working to increase the accessibility and usability of our digital products. OTS offers more resources for expanding accessibility at [Accessible Web Services](https://accessibility.ots.la.gov).

## Accessibility is a Human Right

Accessibility isn’t a line-item that is tacked on at the end of a digital product’s development process. It's a continual part of the development process and product lifecycle. It has to be implemented along with content development, UX, wireframe, design, and development choices. According to a [2022 Centers for Disease Control (CDC) report on Louisianians with disabilities](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/impacts/louisiana.html), 1 in 3 people living in Louisiana had a disability in 2022. This means that an accessibility-first mindset should be the prime factor in developing digital products for Louisiana.

## Ongoing Committment

Pelican endeavours to conform to level AA of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/).[1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/). These guidelines explain how to make web content more accessible for people with disabilities. Conformance with these guidelines will help make the web more user friendly for all people.

This site has been built using code compliant with W3C standards for HTML and CSS. The site displays correctly in current browsers and using standards compliant HTML/CSS code means any future browsers will also display it correctly.

Our ongoing accessibility efforts work toward making Pelican as accessible as possible. [Pelican welcomes comments](/feedback) on how to improve its accessibility for users with disabilities.
