## Overview

Accessibility is a continual part of the development process. It has to be implemented along with content development, UX, wireframe, design, and development choices. 

The Office of Technology Services (O.T.S.), and Pelican, Louisiana’s Design System, are committed to providing digital products that are accessible. We are actively working to increase the accessibility and usability of our digital products.

## Your Role in Accessibility

O.T.S. works to create a culture which cares about accessibility. Part of caring means developing the skills to help create accessible products. O.T.S. has also created <a href="https://accessibility.ots.la.gov" target="_blank">Accessible Web Services</a> to help create a caring culture. This resource presents our roles towards creating accessible products. There are also numerous resource links to help grow your skills for accessibility.

While Pelican strives to create the starting point for accessible products, be sure to build accessibility into your project to serve your users.

## Accessibility is a Human Right

According to a <a href="https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2018/demo/p70-152.pdf" target="_blank">2014 Census report on Americans with disabilities</a>, “...27.2 percent, or 85.3 million, of people living in the United States had a disability in 2014.” This means that an accessibility-first mindset should be an important part of developing digital products for Louisiana.

## Ongoing Committment

Pelican endeavors to conform to level A.A. of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/" target="_blank">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</a> & <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/" target="_blank">2.1</a>. These guidelines explain how to make web content more accessible for people with disabilities. Conformance with these guidelines will help make the web more user friendly for all people.

This site has been built using code compliant with W3C standards for HTML and CSS. The site displays correctly in current browsers and using standards compliant HTML/CSS code means any future browsers will also display it correctly.

Our ongoing accessibility efforts work toward making Pelican as accessible as possible. [Pelican welcomes comments](/feedback) on how to improve its accessibility for users with disabilities.
