## About this Guide

Here you will find guidance for aspects such as:
* Voice and tone
* Appropriate language
* Grammar
    
The goal is to improve the consistency of writing across all Louisiana state government digital products.

The advice found in this document are guidelines, not official rules. If your agency or department follows its own specific style guide, continue to use it.

This is a living document and can be revised as needed.

## Voice and Tone
What is the difference between Voice and Tone?
* **Voice** is what is said.
* **Tone** is how it is said.

Voice should be consistent within an agency or department while tone can, and should, change depending on the situation.

For a clearer explanation of voice and tone, refer to the <a href="https://content-guide.18f.gov/" target="_blank">18F Content Guide</a>:

> Our voice is our unique personality. It can be helpful to think of voice as analogous to a person’s voice. Just as you can identify your best friend in a crowd as soon as you hear her distinctive laugh, you can use an author’s or organization’s voice to identify a piece of writing even if you haven’t seen the byline. A well-crafted voice communicates personality and values -- it’s a distilled representation of an author or organization.

> Tone is more like attitude -- the emotional context of the piece. It can be helpful to think of authorial tone as analogous to a person’s tone of voice. Just as a person would use a somber, sympathetic tone of voice to console a friend about a loss of a pet, an author writing a story about a natural disaster would most likely use a somber, serious tone. Conversely, an author writing a blog post about the launch of a new product might use an enthusiastic, upbeat tone.

The needs of your intended audience should always come first. When writing copy, ask yourself:
* Who is my audience?
* What do I want them to know? What is important?
* How might they feel while reading this?
    
Answering these questions will help establish both a clear voice and an appropriate tone.

Our tone is: 
* Approachable
* Friendly
* Casual, but professional 

## Writing Effective Content
All copy written for Louisiana state government digital products should use conversational, informal language. The goal should be to educate readers without talking down to or confusing them.

Content should be:
* Clear and Concise
* Educational and Specific
* Inclusive
* Trustworthy and Authoritative
    
Use <a href="https://www.plainlanguage.gov/" target="_blank">plain language</a> to make sure content is easy to understand. Plain language is not writing the way you speak. You may be more verbose when speaking. Instead, try to strike a conversational, rather than formal, tone.

Use active voice at all times.

It helps the reader understand who is responsible for actions. You may use passive voice only when it makes the action clearer to the reader.

_**Active Voice:** “Enter your name and password.”_

_**Passive Voice:** “Your name and password should be entered in the spaces provided.”_

Avoid the use of figurative language as well as unfamiliar jargon. Both may lead to misinterpretation of information or confusion.

If legal terminology or jargon is used, also provide a plain language explanation.

Also, try to avoid:
* Goofy jokes or puns
* Figures of Speech
* Mixed Metaphors
* Pop culture references
* Internet abbreviations
   
If content sounds stilted or confusing, consider the following:
* What are you trying to say?
* Are you meeting the needs of your audience?
* Am I using an active or passive voice?
  
Use simple words and short sentences.

When possible, use 2 words or less in sentences. Ideally, keep sentences to fewer than <a href="http://comprehension.prsa.org/?p=217" target="_blank">14 words to enhance reader comprehension</a>.

Avoid long-winded explanations and get to the point.

## Grammar and Spelling
Sticking with certain grammar and spelling rules creates clear, easy to understand writing.

### Capitalization
Use capital letters for proper nouns, such as:
* People
* Places
* Agency Names
* Department Names
    
Capitalize the first letter of every word in titles except for articles, prepositions, and conjunctions.

### Contractions
Use contractions when possible. They help create a less-formal tone and are easier to read.

### Numbers
Use numerals. Write out the number when a it starts a sentence.

### Time
Use a 12-hour clock. Write the time descriptors for before noon and after noon using lowercase letters (am and pm).

### Dates
Write the full date (March 21, 2019) rather than the numerical abbreviation to avoid confusion.

### Agency Abbreviations
Always write the full name of a department or agency the first time it is mentioned. The abbreviated name can be used after.
