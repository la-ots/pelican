## Louisiana State Seal

The Louisiana Seal is used to indicate the authenticity and official status of the application or website.

- Use the SVG file for web use. It will retain its quality and always be as sharp as possible.
- Use the PNG file for print use or if SVG files aren’t suported. It may not always retain sharpness.
