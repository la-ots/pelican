## Best Practices

- 

In general, the premise of the print preview layout design is to focus on what's visible in the main content of the page.
This means that the following components are excluded from ever being printed:

- Skip To Main
- Sidebar with Navigation
- Footer
- Back to Top Button
- Navbar

Other features that work in tandem with other elements (thus only provide a means of interaction and not give information) are able to be excluded from the print preview as well.
These components that follow are able to be optionally hidden:

- Form Elements

<a class="btn btn-primary" href="/foundation/printing-optional/" target="_blank">See Provided Example</a>
