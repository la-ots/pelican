intro: "Pelican Design System is Louisiana’s design system. 
Pelican’s purpose is to bring consistency, user friendliness, and to modernize Louisiana’s websites. It’s built on Bootstrap 4 (we’re working on a Bootstrap 5 version of Pelican) to allow our developers to start quickly. Created with accessibility in mind, we’re always doing our best to improve Pelican for our developers, designers, and most importantly, our users."
