## Make Pelican Better

You can help improve Pelican. Visit the [Feedback Page](/feedback) to learn how to become involved.

We’re continually improving Pelican. The following changes are listed by the date we completed each change.

## 1.0.0 — 24 January 2022

- Version 1.0 released! See [Get Started](/get-started) to begin using Pelican Design System.

Pelican Design System is Louisiana’s design system. 

Pelican’s purpose is to bring consistency, user friendliness, and to modernize Louisiana’s websites. It’s built on Bootstrap 4 (we’re working on a Bootstrap 5 version of Pelican) to allow our developers to start quickly. Created with accessibility in mind, we’re always doing our best to improve Pelican for our developers, designers, and most importantly, our users.
