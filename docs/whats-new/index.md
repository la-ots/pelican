## Make Pelican Better

You can help improve Pelican. Visit the [Feedback Page](/feedback) to learn how to become involved.

We’re continually improving Pelican. The following changes are listed by the date we completed each change.

## 2.0.0 - 01 May 2023

- **Bootstrap 5.** Bootstrap updated from version 4 to version 5. Pelican 2 is based upon Bootstrap 5.2 but Pelican 1 is based upon Bootstrap 4.6. This major change in Bootstrap version required some things to be refactored in the code to accommodate this. See the [Migration Guide](/migration-guide/) for details about how this affects projects built upon Pelican 1 (Bootstrap 4.6).
- **CSS Variables.** Easier code theming for dependent projects. Bootstrap 5 introduces the use of CSS variables to enable better theming flexibility. Be sure to tell your developer.
- **Figma Features.** Pelican’s Figma library gets some refreshes. Figma updates its capabilities and workflows regularly. To keep the Pelican Mockups 2 Library fresh, we will be updating components to stay current with Figma.
