## Best Practices

Allows a Louisiana product to briefly describe a feature with related icons to reinforce the message. In the example below, it’s describing Pelican.
   - The large text is the main benefit or feature, explain in one or two words.
   - The small text explains the main benefit or feature. Keep this explanation as short as possible.
   - Icons set the context for the benefit or feature. Do not use more than three.

## Usage

{% include 'markup/feature-icons-text.njk' %}

``` html
{% include 'markup/feature-icons-text.njk' %}
```
