## Best Practices

Use this when you’re ready to direct the reader to take an action, like signing up.
  - The big text is the action verb for the goal you have for the user. Use this to direct the user an action. This is a decision moment, don’t put a lot of text in here.
  - A Call-to-Action is not navigation. It’s a persuasion item with a link to what you want the user to do.

## Usage

{% include 'markup/feature-cta.njk' %}

``` html
{% include 'markup/feature-cta.njk' %}
