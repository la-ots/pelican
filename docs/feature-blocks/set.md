## Best Practices

Allows the presentation of two smaller aspects about a larger feature. 

- Change text, icons to project needs.
- Change the theme to meet project needs
- Change the button styles (primary, secondary, etc.) for your own brand or dark theme

## Usage

{% include 'markup/feature-set.njk' %}

```html
{% include 'markup/feature-set.njk' %}
```
