## Best Practices

Use this when you’re ready to direct the reader to take an action, but that action must be a decision among two presented. 
  - Do not present more than two choices.
  - This Call-to-Action, like the Call-to-Action Single, is not for navigation; it’s a persuasion item with two choices you present to the user.

## Usage

{% include 'markup/feature-cta-double.njk' %}

``` html
{% include 'markup/feature-cta-double.njk' %}
```
